# eClass Events Scraper

Scrapes for Calendar Events in eClass using Puppeteer

Run `yarn start` to get all Calendar events on eClass. The scraped data is saved in `events.json`

## Why

I've missed too many assignments and quizzes because I don't check eClass regularly.

## Setup

Run `yarn setup` to prompt for CCID, and password.  
Alternatively, you can copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and fill out the variables yourself.

## TODO

- Exit on incorrect password
